## Description 
Built Vision Pro Assisted First-Aid Care at TreeHacks. We ran computer vision on real-time Apple Vision Pro video data to help assist in first-aid care with VR & AR elements! With minimal documentation and no past work in this field, it was a challenge, but we did it within 36 hours! Our pipeline was built ground up and was probably novel.
